# javascript-quiz


## Description

This challenge was to create a quiz with javascript. On page load the user is presented with a button to start the quiz. When the user clicks the start button they are taken to the quiz page where the questions and choices are being rendered. If the user chooses the correct answer, they will see "correct" on the UI. If the user guesses wrong, they will see "wrong" and the time interval will decrease by ten seconds. When the timer reaches zero or the user runs out of questions, the quiz will end and they will be prompted to input their intials. Their initals along with their score (time left on the timer) will be save to local storage. In this challenge, the user was given an option to view high scores and see a list of all initials saved in local storage.
